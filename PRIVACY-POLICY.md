# Privacy Policy

This extension does **not collect**, **store**, or **process** any personal data from users.

The video and audio download functionality is powered by the open-source tool [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp). This tool optionally supports the use of a cookies file provided manually by the user. The cookies file may contain session or authentication information required to access certain restricted content.

However, this extension:

- Does **not read**, **access**, or **store** the contents of the cookies file.
- Simply passes the cookies file path directly to yt-dlp, which handles the request.
- Does not perform any background tracking or data transmission.
- Does not connect to any servers other than the video source (e.g., YouTube), through yt-dlp itself.

All data is processed **locally on the user's machine**, and all optional inputs such as the cookies file are under the full control of the user.

The developer of this extension has **no access** to any user data.

**If you have any concerns or questions**, feel free to open an issue on the GitHub repository.
